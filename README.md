[Download here](https://github.com/maforget/CRDataManager/releases/download/2.07.02.814/Data.Manager_v2.07.02.814.crplugin)  

### docdoom & T3KN0Gh057 proudly present the CR Data Manager, new fixes by maforget.

If you are using ComicRack for Windows to organize your comic library there is sometimes the need to enter data based on rules. So you might want to set the series group to Gotham for all Batman books. Or you scraped your data from ComicVine (using the excellent ComicVine Scraper) and discover that some of the information in the ComicVine database is not correct. So you want to set the publisher information in your library for the first 200+ issues of Walt Disney's Comics & Stories to Dell instead of Boom. This plugin will complete all these tasks automatically.

See the [manual](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/cr-data-manager/Manual_4.0.pdf) for more information about installation and usage. If you would like to discuss the Data Manager you are invited to do so on the [r/comicrackusers subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicrackusers/).
#### Please note: Data Manager works best if you scraped your books before with the excellent and highly recommended [ComicVine Scraper](https://github.com/cbanack/comic-vine-scraper). Also read the [ComicRack Manual](https://sites.google.com/site/comicrackmanual/home) and read the [Organizer guide.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBpXpYx4qN7ZAfz6RSsQJv0ouo8j9Al4/view).
